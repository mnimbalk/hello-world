Business Operations Analyst Intern | AI Enthusiast | Student at Western University

I’m passionate about integrating AI and automation to optimize business operations. As a Business Operations Analyst Intern, I’ve worked on streamlining workflows, implementing custom GPT models to improve efficiency, and identifying irrelevant data to enhance business websites.

At Western University, I’m actively involved in various leadership and sports roles, including as an Orientation Leader and coach for intramural teams like flag football and youth hockey leagues. I’m also working on growing my leadership experience through applications to student clubs.

In my spare time, I’m into Golf, fitness, Ice Hockey, Mountain biking, and Travelling.
